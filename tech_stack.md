# Cloud Storage and API Research
One of our first tasks of this project was to decide which tools we would be using to for our cloud storage and API comonents. After some deliberation and research, it was concluded that Firebase would be used for our cloud storage compnent and for the API an existing databse that was found would be used.
## Firebase
Firebase was selected because it was free for our purposes, could intigrate without our arduino well, and was simple and easy to get started in. The following is the a reference link that was found on how to connect the arduino to our Firebase database and will be used as reference in the future when creating that connection as well. The link to the project database can be found below as well.

## API
The USDA does have a database that can be accessed in a JSON file. This could save work in the future and provides a good basis on structure and content. The interface file can be accessed below.
