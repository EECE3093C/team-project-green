# Meeting 02-24-2023

Meeting time: 11:30am–12:30pm EST
In attendance: all members

## Updates/stand-up

- Obtained two development boards from Professor Loudin, Jack is currently looking into getting that set up with Docker
- Nick is learning Docker in order to create an image for the software repository
- MJ is going to be working on an introduction C++ project for the first sprint
- Hunter has been researching various cloud based services and will get a definite answer soon, looking into Arduino IoT cloud right now

## Repo structure

- Currently it is laid out as follows:
  - "Team Green Project" board encompasses everything
    - team-project-green for documentation and notes
    - team-project-green-software for C++ and desktop software
    - team-project-green-arduino for arduino hardware code
- All tickets created on the Kanban board need to be assigned to an issue for one of the three repositories (use best judgement)
- In-progress tickets require an assignee
- We shouldn't have to move anything to done manually, tag the issue in a comment with the word 'closed'

## Actionables

### Next sprint iteration due: 03-01-2023

- Jack—continue work on Arduino hello-world development
- Nick—create a basic Dockerfile for the software repository
- MJ—start work on a (terminal) menu application in C++ for future use
- Hunter—finalize choice of cloud service and research APIs
