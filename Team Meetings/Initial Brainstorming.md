### Notes:
- Next Tuesday (02/14): planning documents and slideshow due

### General ideas:
- Do we use hardware/micro controllers?
	- Would allow for more interesting projects
	- [List of Arduino sensors for future reference](https://www.electronicshub.org/arduino-modules-list/)
- What programming language?

### Problem ideas:
- Employee management
	-  Clock-in clock-out system to keep track of employee time sheets
		- Maybe something to do with auto-filling tax forms as a problem
- Home automation 
	- System that takes the temperature of house at various intervals, record in a cloud database, and do cost-analysis for energy bill usage
	- System for auto-watering plants using a soil moisture module for Arduino, UI web front-end
