Meeting time: 11:30am–12:30pm EST
In attendance: all members 

- Do we want to go with the plant idea fully?
	- Yes. Arduino will be fun to get into
	- We'll be able to set fun stretch goals with the project to add more modules 
- General overview of the project:
	- Phase 1: main deliverables—minimum viable produce is a soil sensor that collects data, sends the data up to the cloud, compares the data to a plant API in which the user selects their plant, and then displays information to the user about the moisture level and when they need to water their plant
	- Phase 2: stretch goals, unordered:
		- UI (web?) front-end for displaying plant and watering information 
		- Better design in regards to physical unit—case, 3d printed mounting, etc.
		- New Arduino sensors (sunlight, humidity?)
- What is our first sprint going to look like?
	- None of us have a ton of Arduino experience 
	- First sprint could be a deliverable of figuring out a basic program with the board that we're going to be using and getting some data to and from the board 
- Side note: what kind of plant do we want to baby for testing?
	- Potentially one with high water needs and low water needs 
	- Peppers, strawberries, cactus, all options
- Actionables:
	- Jack — finish taking notes, upload to GitHub
	- Team — wait on the project document to drop before deciding on who's working on what for the document write-up and presentation due Tuesday
