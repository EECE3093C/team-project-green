# Team Green - Plant Monitor

## Vision
At a high-level overview, our product is a soil sensor that collects data on moisture levels, compares that to a plant API and displays information on the computer about when the plant should be watered. Our product is designed for everyday people who wish to take care of their plants as well as farmers and botanists who need to keep plants healthy for business or research purposes. Our product solves the problem of needing to manually identify moisture levels and other areas of interest in order to get accurate identifications and notifications on plant health. The field of plant monitoring systems is relatively unexplored in the consumer space, however, there are a few competitors such as the WANFEI Plant Monitor. Our product is novel in the fact that it will utilize a single microcontroller board for entire areas rather than a one to one direct connection from plant to monitor. Additionally, ours will not be tied to a smartphone app and will have direct access to a federal database for accurate information.
